                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
                    acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching,
                    training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the
                    guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in
                    formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                    feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                    Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                    school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                    A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most
                    regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and
                    in particular for evidence-based education.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is an important aspect that plays a huge role in the
                    modern, industrialized world. People need a good education to be able to survive in this competitive
                    world. Modern society is based on people who have high living standards and knowledge which allows
                    them to implement better solutions to their problems.
                    1. Removing Poverty
                    Education helps in removing poverty as if a person is educated, he can get a good job and fulfill
                    all the basic needs & requirement of his family.

                    2. Safety and Security against Crime
                    If a person is well-educated, he will not be fooled by anyone easily. An educated person is less
                    prone to involve in domestic violence & other social evils. They enjoy healthy relationships in
                    life. This means people are less susceptible to being cheated or becoming a victim of violence.

                <p class="sectionTag text-big">Role of Education in Society</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the social institution through which society provides
                    its members with important knowledge, including basic facts, job skills, and cultural norms values.

                    One of the most important benefits of education is that it improves personal lives and helps the
                    society to run smoothly. By providing education, poverty can be removed and every person can provide
                    their contribution to developing the country.

                    Education Helps in Creation of a better society.
                    An educated person is more likely to develop better moral and ethical values as compared to an
                    uneducated person. Lack of education creates problems like superstition, domestic violence, poor
                    health, and poor living standards. Education brings equal opportunity for both men and women and
                    educated people will be able to create a better society. Without a good education, a better society
                    canâ€™t be formed. Education act as Back Bone of a Society.
